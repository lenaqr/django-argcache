# HERE BE DRAGONS!
#
# This code is partially copied from the django source for
# django.template.base.Library.inclusion_tag, and was last updated for Django
# 1.8.  All changes from the Django source we're copying should be commented
# inline with "# CHANGED:" to make this easy to update.
#
# The reason we're here in the first place is that just caching a function,
# then passing it to register.inclusion_tag will cache the computation of the
# tag's context, but not its rendering, which doesn't do us much good.  So we
# have to roll our own node that modifies InclusionNode, which django doesn't
# really support.  (In fact, we can't even inherit from InclusionNode, because
# it's defined *inside* register.inclusion_tag.)  In addition, template
# rendering is complicated, and caching a part of it has some weird subtleties
# that we have to deal with.
#
# The process of rendering an inclusion tag goes roughly like this:
#                       1                 2                    3
#    tag args, context --> function args --> template context --> rendered node
#
# In Django's InclusionNode, the render() method does all of these.  We don't
# want our caching to depend on the tag's surrounding context, because that
# will probably never be the same twice, so we can't cache step 1.  That's
# okay, because it's fast, and not really a part of the computation one would
# expect to be done by the tag -- it belongs to the surrounding context, and
# the computation model just happens to put it inside the tag.
#
# So we want to cache steps 2 and 3.  (2 is of course just our underlying
# function.)  We might as well cache them as a single step, because it's easier
# that way.  But the problem is that we don't know the args of the underlying
# function here, and argcache doesn't support *args/**kwargs, so we can't
# actually write a function which takes the same argspec as the underlying
# function and pass it to argcache.
#
# Now we *can* just write a function which takes in a list of arguments and
# returns a rendered node, and that's what we do (render_given_args).  But that
# function won't have the argspec that the user expects, so they can't easily
# add cache dependencies to it.  (It's also suboptimal, because we won't be
# able to expire argument-by-argument, but we'll just have to live with that
# one.  So we *also* set up a cache for our underlying function, and then wire
# up the cache of render_given_args to depend on it.
#
# Beyond that, it's just a bunch of copy-pasting and inserting cache code, with
# a bunch of subtleties and a few dirty tricks, commented inline.
#
# TODO(benkraft): once our version of Django contains 655f5249 (which I believe
# will be in 1.9) this will need to be rewritten to match Django's version
# again.  I hope we will be able to simplify it by inheriting from
# InclusionNode instead of copying it.  But a lot of the issues that cause us
# to have to change more code than just adding some `cache_function`s will
# still apply, so we may not be so lucky.
#
# TODO(benkraft): figure out if there's a remotely clean way of doing this.
# Perhaps even file a bug against django to have them make it easier on their
# side.
#
# CHANGED: changed self to register in the function definition, and changed the
# function name to cache_inclusion_tag
def cache_inclusion_tag(register, file_name, takes_context=False, name=None):
    """
    Register a callable as an inclusion tag, cachedly.

    This function will cache the rendering of an inclusion tag.  It works more
    or less like `register.inclusion_tag`, subject to the gotchas below.
    You may use the caching API to add dependencies for automatic invalidation
    by accessing the 'cached_function' attribute of the decorated function.

    Parameters:
    * register should be `template.Library()`.
    * file_name should be the template file to use, or a `Template()` object.
    * takes_context and name are as in `register.inclusion_tag`.

    For example:

    from django import template
    from esp.web.util.template import cache_inclusion_tag

    register = template.Library()

    @cache_inclusion_tag(register, 'path/to/template.html')
    def fun_tag(foo, bar, baz):
        return {'foo': foo}
    fun_tag.cached_function.depend_on_row(lambda: SomeModel, lambda some_instance: {'foo': some_instance.foo})

    Note that you will need to import the template tag from somewhere that will
    get imported on server startup, likely utils/inclusion_tags.py, to make
    sure that the caching code gets set up correctly.

    GOTCHAS:
      * cache_inclusion_tag will always pass a Context through to the template,
        no matter what type of context is passed to it.  This is to prevent
        having non-explicit access to e.g. RequestContext.request, which could
        cause caching bugs and let one user see data from another, if we're not
        careful.  If you want to have access to any request vars in a
        cache_inclusion_tag, you must pass them through manually.
      * `{% csrf_token %}` won't work inside a cache_inclusion_tag.  We
        shouldn't be caching a csrf_token, ever.  If you need one, don't cache
        your inclusion tag, or populate it client-side.
      * cache_inclusion tags doesn't support passing keyword arguments.  This
        is due to argcache limitations.
      * template tags that make heavy use of render_context might not work
        properly, since using render_context can make identical calls to the
        same tag render differently.  If you don't know what any of that means,
        it probably won't hurt you; as of Django 1.8, the only built-in tag
        that might require care is `{% cycle %}`.
      * Unlike cache_function, using cache_inclusion_tag to decorate a class
        method is not supported.
